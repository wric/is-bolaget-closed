# Is bolaget closed?

This site provides endpoints to query for deviation in opening hours for Systembolaget. I created this site due to my own inability to remember and plan for than a few days ahead. This backfired more than once when forgetting about holidays etc and lead to me missing out of on great beverages and memories.

All data and search funcitonality is provided by Systembolaget official API. You can find more information about it on [https://api-portal.systembolaget.se/](https://api-portal.systembolaget.se/) and everything else on Systembolaget official website [https://www.systembolaget.se/](https://www.systembolaget.se/).

## Instructions

Search and find your favorite store. Today's and tomorrow's closing time will show in the list. If the store is closed one day a closed sign is visible instead of the time. If the store's closing time deviates from the normal it will be flagged with a red color. Click the ðŸ”— button to get to the status endpoint. Create an automated daily request to the endpoint, use the `daysAhead` query parameter and let technology warn you when opening hours are deviating. Check `isDeviant` for deviations.

## Gotchas

- Sundays are always closed and are therefore not a deviation.
- Stores always open at 10:00 and therefore opening time is not displayed.
